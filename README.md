## Pocket window manager for embedded X applications

Tmanager is a program that acts like a tiling, shortcut-driven window manager for embedded applications (primarily terminal emulators) for X window system.

Inspired by real tiling WMs for Linux, tmanager provides the functionality to open, select, move, resize, and close windows, navigate between tabs, thus allowing to easily create complex window layouts.

It's written entirely in C using the XCB library, which provides a low-level way to communicate with the X server
